Some help you could eventually need :
If you want to draw a line, a rectangle or an ellipse, 
just click on the left button of your mouse and keep the 
button pressed until you want to validate the item.
If you want to draw a polygon, you will have to click on the 
left button for each point you want to place a vertex, 
unless for the last vertex, you will have to double-click 
to validate the polygon.
To delete an item, select the erase tool and click on each 
item you want to remove from the scene.
